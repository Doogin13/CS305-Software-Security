# CS305-Software-Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They are seeking to modernize their operations using the most current and effective software security to ensure the secure transfer of user data using their RESTful web application programming interface. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

After identifying the software seurity vulnerabilities, I was able to strengthen the system security. It is important to code securely because there are constant threats to security at all times and a weak or not properly secure code is vulnerable to attacks. Code security is vital to the overall reputation of a company's well being. Maintaining the security of clients determines the value of a company.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found several areas to be challenging to me. Running the dependency check was a challenge at first until I managed to resolve the errors. The hash algorithm posed a bit of a challenge for me concerning the message digest because I had to create a class to throw and exception in order for it to function correctly. Being able to correctly identify and locate the files that are necessary for the development of code is vital in order to suppress any threats to the security system.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased the layers of security by running the dependency checks and identifying errors that are present in the system. I would implement authentication an encrypted security. In the future, I wouldI use penetrating tools and vulnerability assessment tools to determine the appropriate ways to prevent attacks.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I would ensure the code is error free. I opened up the localhost to confirm the output was correct. I would verify the site was accessed via https the self-signed certificate. After refactoring the code, I checked to see if there were any vulnerabilities by running another dependency check and cross checking the results from the previous one.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Vulnerability scanning tools, code practices, and penetrating tools I found to be helpful in future assignments or taskss.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

As an example of my work, I could show future employers the secure code I wrote for Artemis Financial, the vulnerability assessment report, and the steps I took to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. This would demonstrate my skills, knowledge, and experience in software security.
